I was supposed to learn how to use lists to write a program that stores multiple different
values in it. The first thing we did was we tried to make sure we knew what each place in the list stood for
and how to make sure we were entering values in the right spot. Our results do match what we
expected to get and when putting in an invalid amount of rolls, the program makes the user
input another amount until it is valid. The biggest challenge was trying to make sure
each function worked properly and that  we called the right variables when needed.
We first designed the program, then wrote the program, then tested it to make sure it worked
properly. I think I learned what I was supposed to in this lab, as I am now 
more comfortable with lists and indexes when coding. Working with Jordi was nice.
